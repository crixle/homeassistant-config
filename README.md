# Crixle's Dashboard
I've always loved HomeKit, but it lacks functionality and integration with many of my devices so I created this dashboard to give off iOS vibes but gives me the versatility my smart home needs. </br>
</br>
**NOTE: Some cards have their code provided allowing simple copy and pasting into your own dash, however most require button templates provides in the rep files. As always, replace my entities with yours otherwise cards won't work.**

# Room Tabs
  
  I've retired my old method of room control, which was a [state-switch card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-state-switch) with all the lights organized by room. Due to it's instability and performance issues, I've created room tabs! Room tabs show me what I need to know about the rooms at a glance but let me change the lights and the TV when I click on it.
 
![RoomTabs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54859942/148406102-01ded048-724e-467f-9da5-106450363cfc.gif)
Each room card is based off a [group](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/group/) that automatically populates on boot or when I tell it to. See [auto-populating groups](#auto-populating-groups) for more info!

# Floor Plan
  
  This card is my favorite because it's informative and let's me look at the entire house in a glance. Best part is that it was relatively easy to make with a bit of patience. I followed [this guide](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/floorplan-ui-with-color-synced-lights/169417) and had it working within a couple hours. The guide allows you to sync the color to match color and brightness, but I had issues with color matching not being accurate so I just match brightness.

##### This code is very complex, and will not work on your dash by copying and pasting. Because it's using JavaScript to work, if any of the entities are incorrect it will just crash and not load anything. Use my code as a reference to yours.

# Auto-Populating Groups
So, picture this. You just replaced a Hue bulb in your bedroom and now you need to go update it in Home Assistant. You've done that and all is well again, until you go to bed.
In your excitement, you didn't add the new bulb to the correct room in Google Home. So when you say, "Hey Google, turn off the lights", it turns them all off except the new one.
Now, you have to get up and MANUALLY turn off that light like a CAVEMAN and dump your sorry ass back into bed. So to prevent that from happening again, I created this script.

When I add/replace lights in my home, it's incredibly annoying to have to go modify Home Assistant, HomeKit, and Google Assistant when I really only use HK and GA for turning lights on and off. So, my solution was to create groups that automatically create themselves based off areas with a simple script. All I have to do is setup the device in HA then add it to the appropriate area and the rest is automatic. Only the 'group' entities are exposed to GA and HK so that when I say "turn off the lights", it turns off the lights based off the Home Assistant area. 
The script is ran everytime Home Assistant starts or if I manually call it.

# Theme
  
  My light theme is heavily built upon [ios dark mode themes](https://github.com/basnijholt/lovelace-ios-dark-mode-theme) with some tweaks and a custom background made by me! I recently got a new laptop with an OLED screen so I've fully embraced the dark side with my dark theme. Both the background and the code is provided in the files!
 ##### Optional: The font I'm using is [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) and you have to import that into your dashboard resources! Check out [this guide](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/adding-resources-to-lovelace/180729) and look at the 2nd post for reference!
 

# Wall Mounted Tablet
  
  I have a Kindle Fire 10 (2019) mounted to the wall with a few command strips, and it works beautifully! I initially used FullyKiosk to isolate Home Assistant, however it can only access a really old version of Android WebView which made it really slow and unresponsive. I was shocked when I tried WallPanel and it works almost flawlessly! I know leaving the Kindle plugged in 24/7 is really bad for the battery but :shrug:
